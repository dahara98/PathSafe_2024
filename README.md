# Implementation of the paper 'PathSafe: Secure Path Verification in Software-Defined Networks'

## Abstract

Network topology verification in Software-Defined Networks (SDN) poses a significant challenge, as vulnerabilities can allow attackers to deceive the controller and manipulate the data plane into incorrect topologies, thereby endangering the entire network's security. Current solutions fail to guarantee both security and efficiency in the verification process, often resulting in damaging user traffic.
With the aim of solving joint objectives, in this paper, we introduce *PathSafe*, a novel tool constructed on top of the existing controller frameworks designed for secure path verification in SDN environments. It enables the verification of all available paths between two points in the network and ensures a secure process. Our approach requires a data plane component for real-time packet monitoring at line speed and a control plane verification step. Our research demonstrates that *PathSafe* effectively mitigates security risks in compromised switches and host scenarios. Alongside a theoretical exploration of this challenge, we present a proof of concept implemented in P4, a common language for programmable data planes. Results obtained in Mininet underscore the practical applicability of *PathSafe* that, compared to alternatives, reduces overhead in the verification process while maintaining a limited execution time.
